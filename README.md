## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is divided into two main categories:

- **Academic**
- **Practical**

---

## 🎓 Academic

The academic section focuses on:

- Theoretical concepts  
- Exam preparation  
- Fundamental formulas and system theory (also known as dynamic systems theory)

---

## 🛠️ Practical

The practical section includes the actual software tools that:

- Perform system calculations  
- Help solve real-world problems  

> 🔄 The software is continuously updated. Suggestions and direct contributions are welcome!

# 📍 This are the main features likely to be implemented:
( 🟥 - not yet implemented | 🟩 - implemented and working | 🟨 - implemented but not working good )
NAME                                      | STATUS
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors evaluation = 🟩
- Autonomous stability evaluation         = 🟥
- Qualitative Bode plot                   = 🟩
- Qualitative Nyquist plot                = 🟩
- Laplace transform and inverse transform = 🟨
- Z transform and inverse transform       = 🟨
- Kalman decomposition                    = 🟥
